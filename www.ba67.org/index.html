    <p>80s BASIC Interpreter</p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p><code>BA67</code> (pronounced BASIC SEVEN) is a standalone BASIC interpreter,
that can be used as a daily tool on a personal computer.</p>
<p>It is inspired by the <code>COMMODORE BASIC V7 (C)1977</code> from the C128.
Three times the digit 7 led to it's name BA67.</p>
<p><img src="screenshot.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>If you're familiar with the C64/C128, you will quickly find
yourself comfortable with this interpreter. But BASIC is also
a very easy to learn programming language as well as an
operating system. So it suits perfectly for beginners as
well.</p>
<p>Many have programmed BASIC interpreters before, so why
another? Well, they all had some sort of limitations,
or were written in some strange language that I don't like.</p>
<p>This BASIC is compatible with COMMODORE's BASIC V7,
but also features some improvements.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>Back in the 80s, everyone could start a computer and program
a simple</p>
<pre><code class="basic language-basic">10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
20 GOTO 10
</code></pre>
<p>These days there are so many languages and programs to install
before the fun starts, that many do not even bother to
try it.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to get people to start
programming.</p>
<p>It aims to provide a BASIC language, that sticks to a very
widespread standard, keep backwards compatiblity and focus
on an easy to learn language with easy to understand syntax
and few keywords.</p>
<p>Keeping the backwards compatiblity also enables you to have
AI generators answer your questions.</p>
<p>Complex operators, module definitions, structures and
inheritance are excluded on purpose. Yet, the language
should offer a modular approach for complex programs
without introducing complex syntax.</p>
<p>The very final goal would be to have a standalone hardware,
that boots to this BASIC.</p>
<p>It features a screen editor that should behave as the retro
one does.</p>

    <code>LINUX</code><br />
    Currently, BA67 is designed to convert a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/">Raspberry&nbsp;Pi&nbsp;400</a> into a
    standalone computer, that boots into the BA67 interpreter.<br />
    For testing, an image of <a href="https://dietpi.com/">dietpi.com</a> was used.
    In order to start the conversion process, download and run
    - <b>at your own risk</b> - this script: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KungPhoo/ba67-basic/refs/heads/main/update.sh">update.sh</a>.<br />
    Don't sue me if your files are deleted, your sd card gets broken or your house gets on fire.
    I did my best to make this working, but things <b>might not work</b> as intended. Do backup
    all important data before you run this script.
</p>
<p>
    <code>WINDOWS, MAC</code><br />
    While it might acutally work on a MAC, I've not tested it so far.<br />
    In order to install this on Windows, get a C++ IDE (VSCodium e.g.) and install
    git, CMake, make and a C++ compiler.
    Go to a directory and type <code>git -c user.name=JohnDoe -c user.email=me@privacy.net clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules https://github.com/KungPhoo/ba67-basic.git ba67</code>.<br />
    Then, open the CMakesList.txt or (depending on your setup) that folder in your IDE and compile the program. If you don't know how to do that,
    be patient unil there might be setups.
