## About
BA67 (pronounced BASIC SEVEN) is a standalone BASIC interpreter,
that can be used as a daily tool on a personal computer.

It is inspired by the Commodore BASIC V7 ©1977 from the C128.
Three times the digit 7 led to it's name BA67.

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

If you're familiar with the C64/C128, you will quickly find
yourself comfortable with this interpreter. But BASIC is also
a very easy to learn programming language as well as an
operating system. So it suits perfectly for beginners as
well.

Many have programmed BASIC interpreters before, so why
another? Well, they all had some sort of limitations,
or were written in some strange language that I don't like.

This BASIC is compatible with COMMODORE's BASIC V7,
but also features some improvements.

Here are the key features:
- Compatible with the famous Commodore BASIC
- Can load .prg files
- Can save .prg files
- GOTO/GOSUB labels (backwards compatible!)
- Variable names can be longer than 2 characters
- Dictionaries (key/value pair lookup tables)
- Unicode strings (no PETSCII or other exotic char sets)
- Full Unicode character set (even emoji end stuff)
- 64 bit precision for numbers
- 64 bit integers
- Modular programming (See keyword `MODULE`)
- Direct access to your local file system
- Easy access to proprietary cloud storage (See `CLOUD`)
- Get data from the internet (See `NETGET`)
- Written in C++ (using some C libraries)
- Very easy to use as a scripting language in your projects
- Easy to port to other platforms
- Liberal license


-------------------------------------------------------------
## Goal
Back in the 80s, everyone could start a computer and program
a simple
```
10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
20 GOTO 10
```

These days there are so many languages and programs to
install before the fun starts, that many do not even bother
to try it.

The goal of this project is to get people to start
programming.

It aims to provide a BASIC language, that sticks to a very
widespread standard, keep backwards compatibility and focus
on an easy to learn language with easy to understand syntax
and few keywords.

Keeping the backwards compatibility also enables you to have
AI generators answer your questions.

Complex operators, module definitions, structures and
inheritance are excluded on purpose. Yet, the language
should offer a modular approach for complex programs
without introducing complex syntax.

The very final goal would be to have a standalone hardware,
that boots to this BASIC.

It features a screen editor that should behave as the retro
one does.

Graphics and sound were added.

For the graphics an 40x25 character graphics with 16 colors
is set. Each character is monochrome or multicolor.
Characters can be easily generated with the `CHARDEF`
command and supports the full Unicode range
(uses a map internally).

For the sound, the ABC music notation is used. For sound
effects, DrPetter's SFXR is used. See `PLAY` and `SOUND`.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax
This interpreter tries to imitate and extend
COMMODORE's BASIC V7.

### Case Sensitive
The parser is case sensitive, but the line input uppercases
everything outside of quotes for convenience.

### Spacing
Keywords must be separated with spaces, operators or braces.
The COMMODORE allowed `LETTER=1`, which was interpreted as
`LET TER=1` instead of `LET LETTER=1`. Also `PRINT LETTER`
was not possible, because the LET part was interpreted as a
command instead of the variable name.

In order to avoid confusions, this BASIC requires separating
commands from variables.

If you load a '.prg' program file, the spaces will be added
automatically. Attention: This might cause lines to be
longer than 80 characters - which is not supported by the
8 bit computers.

### Quotes
You can use double and single quotes. This way it's easier
You can use double and single quotes. This way it's easier
to use quotes in a string. The following is perfectly legal,
but breaks compatibility with Commodore BASIC V7.0 code:
```
PRINT "Print 'single quotes' is easy"
PRINT 'but: "double quotes" is, too.'
```
In BASIC V7.0, only double quotes are accepted. To escape
these, you'd have to print `CHR$(34)`.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Editor
The editor imitates the C64/C128 text editor. Use the `ESC`
key to abort a program execution or the listing of `CATALOG`
or `LIST`.

The F1 .. F12 keys are preprogrammed with some BASIC keywords
and can be configured using the KEY command.

Use Alt+INS key to toggle between insert mode and overwrite
mode. Use the INS key alone to insert a single character
space.

When you press `CTRL+1..8` or `SHIFT+CTRL+1..8`, a special
character is printed, that advices the interpreter to change
the text color.
Pressing `ALT+CRSR` or `ALT+HOME` prints a character that
moves the cursor.

`ALT+END` is a character to clear the screen.

Annex D shows the list of control characters.

The Scroll Lock and the Shift keys can be used to pause
commands, that list large texts to the screen. Try the `LIST`
command or `CATALOG` on large directories.

When you press Ctrl+'.', the BA67 starts the emoji-panel
program if it can find it. Here you can pick an emoji or
Unicode character and insert it at the current cursor
position. You can find that program as well on
[github](https://github.com/KungPhoo/stdout-emoji-panel).


-------------------------------------------------------------
## Numbers
Number constants can be given in scientific notation
(-1.3e-5) or as floating point input (1.23). The decimal
separator is the period symbol, regardless of the computer's
locale settings.

Integers can be given up to 64 bits. A prefixed `$` is
interpreted as a hex number. `a = $7ffffff`.

Commodore allowed the dot `.` to be interpreted as zero.
BA67 can allow this with the options.dotAsZero=true set.
That's the default. Please don't do this in new projects.
People did this because parsing '.' was faster than '0' in
Commodore BASIC.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Unicode
This interpreter has full Unicode support. Even emoji 😀.
The Windows console, however, cannot display characters
above 0xffff and will display two characters instead ☹.

LEN, MID$ etc. work with Unicode code-points, so
LEN("äöü") = 3, even though the parser stores 6 utf8
bytes, internally.


-------------------------------------------------------------
## Variables
Variables can be double, integer or string variables and 
arrays of these.
Integers have a % postfix, where strings end with $.
The double variable 'a' and the integer variable 'a%' are
two separate variables. Also, arrays can have the same name
as non-array variables and are treated as separate variables.
(That's compatible with CBM BASIC)

There are built-in variables, that will be updated before
each statement is evaluated. These are:

| Variable  |  Value                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| TI        | current system time in 1/60 sec.   |
| ST        | file I/O status (currently not set)|

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Files
### Filesystem
Internally, the file system is no case sensitive. Even on
operating systems that are! So you can load "GAME.BAS", even
if the file is names "game.bas" on the drive. Same goes for
overwriting existing files.

In most cases you can use wildcard characters `*` and `?`
for loading existing files.

### Supported file formats
BA67 can load .prg files from the C64 (BASIC V2)and
C128 (BASIC 7.0) natively. The filename foe `QSAVE` is
changed to a '.bas' file extension, though, since some
graphical characters are mapped to Unicode and cannot be
mapped back to PETSCII properly, yet.

You can, however, save as a '.prg' file that you can load
in your emulator (try drag&drop) or edit it with
[DirMaster](https://style64.org/dirmaster).

All other files are loaded as UTF-8 text files. a UTF-8
[BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)
is accepted but mandatory. Saving will write UTF-8 without BOM.

When saving to a .prg file (only for export - don't use this
as your development format!), the Unicode characters in
strings are mapped back to PETSCII. See annex G for details.

### Cloud file storage
With `CLOUD` you can specify a webserver, that BA67 can use
as a remote drive. There are no subdirectories on a cloud
storage.
You simply `CHDIR "CLOUD"` to navigate the current directory
to the previously defined cloud storage.
See the `CLOUD` command for details.

### boot.bas
The C++ class that derives from the C++ class `Os` should
set the start directory to a location, where BASIC programs
are to be saved.

When starting, the interpreter will load and run the
file "boot.bas" from the start directory and call `NEW`
to clear all variables.

You can edit and save this file for your needs and e.g.
adjust the `KEY` shortcuts etc.

The interpreter can load files without line numbers and will
numerate them automatically.

### PETCAT
!! TODO do not use this anymore - BA67 can load .prg files !!

If you add the line number 1 and start with the comment
`1 REMBA67` - no spaces between `REM` and `BA67` - then
the interpreter switches to the Commodore style parsing and
reformats your code with spaces.

The line `1 REMBA67` also can add more keywords. These are
 - `PETCAT` parse the `petcat` program's escaping of
            characters. Use e.g.
            `petcat -70 -f -o "output.bas" -- "input.prg"`

After loading, the parser returns to the default behaviour.
Don't forget to backup and remove line `1` before saving.

See Annex G for mapping PETSCII to Unicode.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Keywords, Commands, Functions
The following is a list of the BASIC hard-coded language
tokens you can use to write programs. They are split in 3
groups, where the first two can be considered as one - only
if you want to look at the source code, you will find these
two different groups. So, here keywords and commands are
put in the same list for a better reference.

Functions always take at least one argument in braces.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Commands and Keywords
### ABOUT
**Usage:** `ABOUT`

Prints the 'about this project' and license message.

### AUTO
**Usage:** `AUTO [n]`
Enables automatic line numbering. This aids you when writing
programs by printing the next line number at the input prompt
after a line has been programmed by adding `n` to the
previously entered line number.

Calling AUTO with no argument disables this feature.

When a line already exists, BA67 will print the contents of
this line to prevent you from overwriting existing code.


### BAKE
**Usage:** `BAKE`

BA67 provides a compatible way to use labels for `GOTO` and
`GOSUB` calls.

The original CBM BASIC interpreter ignores any data behind
the GOTO number until the next command. So we can append a
label text after the number and the program still works.

The `BAKE` command finds such GOTO/GOSUB line numbers and
replaces them with the correct line numbers.

In order to provide a label, just use a line with a `REM`
comment, that only includes the label sourraounded by two
minus characters like this:
```
REM --LABEL--
```
The label must not start with a number and only contain
A-Z,a-z,0-9 and _ as characters. No spaces. The labels
are case sensitive! Better only use uppercase letters.

Attention: The does not work with `ON..GOTO/GOSUB` in
CBM BASIC, so BA67 does not support it either.


### CATALOG
**Usage:** `CATALOG [filter$]`

Lists all files and directories of the current directory.
Optionally, you can provide a wildcard filter string.


### CLOSE
**Usage:** `CLOSE fileno`

Closes a file handle.

### CLR
**Usage:** `CLR`

Clears all variables.

### COLOR
**Usage:** `COLOR source405, color1`

Set text or background color. The `source` is an indicator
what color to change.
```
0 or 6: Background (C128: 0)
1 or 5: Text color (C128: 5)
4     : Border color (only if available)
```
The default `color` values are:
- 1 Black
- 2 White
- 3 Red
- 4 Cyan
- 5 Purple
- 6 Green
- 7 Blue
- 8 Yellow
- 9 Orange
- 10 Brown
- 11 Light Red
- 12 Dark Gray
- 13 Medium Gray
- 14 Light Green
- 15 Light Blue
- 16 Light Gray

If you want to **redefine** a color, the syntax is:
`COLOR color, red, green, blue`
Where `red`, `green` and `blue` are values from 0 to 255 or
$00 to $ff.

**NOTE** If you break the program with the `ESC` key, the
colors are reset to the defaults.

In order to change the background and text color for a
a text on the screen, one technique is

`COLOR 5, 3 : CHAR 8, 10, 10, "M", 1`

In Detail:
- Set text color to 3 (red)
- Invert the colors (last argument of `CHAR`)
- Print "M" with text color 8 (yellow)
- Result: yellow M on red background

In C128 BASIC, the background color could be changed with
`POKE 53281, color0`. The border color can be set with
`POKE 53280, color0`.
The C64 can set the text color with `POKE 646, color0`.
The C128 pendant would be `POKE 241, color0`, where
`color0` is the zero based color index.


### CHAR
**Usage:** `CHAR color, column0, line0, text$[, inverse]`

Positions the cursor position to `column,line`, where the top
left screen corner is at position `0,0`.
Then prints the given string at that position and leaves the
cursor at the end of the printed string's position.
Other BASICs have a command `LOCATE` or `PRINT AT` for this.

The parameter `color` was ignored on the C128, but here it is
used as the text color index. See `COLOR` for possible values
from 0 to 16. The color 0 (or omitting the parameter) uses
the current text color.

The command will leave the cursor at the end of the text
and restore the current text color.

### CHARDEF
**Usage:** `CHARDEF char$, bytes [, more bytes]`

Defines the pixels of a character symbol.

**Monochrome**

You can define any Unicode character with this command.
Each parameter is a byte (8 bits), that describe the
horizontal pixels of a line. You must pass 8 lines.

Alternatively, you can pass all 8 bytes as a single number,
since BA67 supports 64 bit integers.
So `CHARDEF "A", $ff22334455667788` is valid.

Use the `CHR$()` command, if you want to give the Unicode
code point as a value.

Here's an online generator for monochrome chars:
[matrix-emoji](https://jorydotcom.github.io/matrix-emoji/).

**Multicolor**

If your pixel size ix 8x8 (default) and you pass 8 values
of 32 bits. They are interpreted as 16 bit color indices.
So each byte represents 2 pixels. In order to distinguish
these 8 values from the 8 bytes of a monochrome character,
one value must be greater than $ff.

Pay attention: The color values are 0..15 - instead of the
color values in `COLOR`, which are 1 based.

Example:
```basic
10 CHARDEF "$",24,36,32,112,32,98,92,0
20 READ C$, A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H
30 CHARDEF C$, A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H
40 PRINT "$$$ ###"
100 REM MULTICOLOR IMAGE
110 DATA "#"
120 DATA $11111144
130 DATA $11144444
140 DATA $11144444
150 DATA $14444444
160 DATA $14444446
170 DATA $14446666
180 DATA $44446666
190 DATA $44466666
```


`CHARDEF "#", $00, $11, $11, $00,  $11, $22, $22, $11,  $12, $33, $33, $21,  $13, $44, $44, $31,  $14, $55, $55, $41,  $15, $66, $66, $51,  $01, $77, $77, $10,  $00, $18, $81, $00`

You can read the bits of a character with the
keyword `RCHARDEF`.


**Example**
```basic
10 CHARDEF "$",24,36,32,112,32,98,92,0
20 PRINT "$$$$"
RUN
```

**NOTE** If you break the program with the `ESC` key, the
characters 0..127 (ASCII set) reset to the defaults.


### CHDIR
**Usage:** `CHDIR directory`

Change into the given directory.

The CHDIR command also supports wild-card characters.
use `CHDIR ".."` to go one directory level up.

BA67 uses the forward slash `/` on all platforms as
as directory separator.

The spacial command `CHDIR "CLOUD"` is described in the
`CLOUD` command.


### CLOUD
**Usage:** `CLOUD email$ [, server$]`

Specifies the cloud storage parameters.
BA67 can load and write files to a cloud storage. See the
file `cloud.php` in the `www.ba67.org` folder of the source
code to host our own cloud service.

When you `CHDIR "CLOUD"`, all read and write access will
be done on the cloud you provided. You can go back to
your local file system with `CHDIR "."`.

If you have a local directory "CLOUD" and want to change
to that directory, you can do so with  `CHDIR "./CLOUD"`.

See annex for more details.

### DATA
**Usage:** `DATA value, value, string, "string with spaces", ...`

Provides data variables to be used with the READ keyword.
Empty values `DATA ,,,` are also allowed. But, please don't
use them.

### DEF FN
**Usage** `DEF FN NAME(ARG[, ARG2, ...]) = ARG+ARG2...*`

Provides a way to define user functions, that can be called.
Internally, the function name always starts with FN, so this
is the only place, where `FN FOO` and `FNFOO` are valid and
equal.

### DELETE
**Usage:** `DELETE from [- to]`

Deletes the line numbers in the given range.


### DIM
**Usage:** `DIM var(size)`

Allocates an array with the specified size.

Example:
```basic
DIM A(10)
```

If the size is omitted, the CBM BASIC yields a
`SYNTAX ERROR`. BA67 will set the array as a
dictionary. You can then use any kind of values
as the key and store data.

**Example:**
```
10 DIM A$() : REM CREATE DICTIONARY
20 A$("KEY1") = "VALUE 1"
...
30 PRINT A$("KEY1")
DUMP
```

### DUMP
**Usage:** `DUMP [var][,var ...]`

Prints all variable values to the current output device.

Optionally, you can specify only the variable name to
dump.

### END
**Usage:** `END`

Terminates program execution.

### FAST
**Usage:** `FAST`

Enables fast mode for this `MODULE`. That's the default
speed. No delay will be added. See also `SLOW`.

### FIND
**Usage:** `FIND "print*hello world"`

Searches the current module's program listing for the given
search string. The search is performed case-insensitive
and you can use the wild-cards `*` and `?`.
A `*` is appended at the front and the back, internally.

The command will act as `LIST`, but only list the lines where
the search string was matches.

### FN
See the `DEF FN` description, please.

### FOR
**Usage:** `FOR var = start TO end [STEP increment]`

Begins a loop with an optional increment.

Example:
```basic
FOR I = 1 TO 10 STEP 2
```

Internally a call stack is used for all kind of loops.

[C64-wiki.com](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/FOR) states:
C64 BASIC deals with information about FOR-NEXT loops on
the return stack in one of four ways:

- When the `FOR-NEXT` loop terminates normally,
    the information is removed from the return stack.
- When a program encounters a `NEXT` statement with an
    explicit loop variable, all inner loops are
    cancelled and their information removed from the
    return stack.
- All `FOR-NEXT` loops commenced within a subroutine are
    terminated and their information removed
    from the return stack when the program encounters a
    `RETURN` statement.
- If a `FOR` statement is encountered, any existing loop
    using the same variable name along with
    any subsequent unfinished `FOR-NEXT` loops are
    terminated and their information removed from the
    return stack.

### GET
**Usage:** `GET a$ [, b$, ...]`

Gets a key press from the keyboard buffer. Will return
an empty string, if the buffer is empty.


### GRAPHIC
**Usage:** `GRAPHIC mode5`

Changes the current graphics mode. Currently only two modes
are supported:
 - `1..4` Switches back to default 40 column mode
 - `5`    Switches to 80 column mode

In the 80 column mode, each character still is 8x8 pixels.
However, the display is scaled to it looks like they're 8x16
pixels. You can change that in the code. See also `CHARDEF`.

### GOSUB
**Usage:** `GOSUB line`

Calls a subroutine at the specified line number. Execution
resumes after a `RETURN`. The `FOR-NEXT` stack from inside
the subroutine is popped from the stack.

See the `FOR` command for how the call stack is maintained,
internally.

See the `BAKE` command for how to use labels instead of
line numbers.

Example:
```basic
GOSUB 200
```

### GOTO
**Usage:** `GOTO line`

Jumps to the specified line number unconditionally.

Example:
```basic
GOTO 100
```

See the `BAKE` command for how to use labels instead of
line numbers.

### HELP
**Usage:** `HELP command`

Prints a small information about how to use the command.

### IF
**Usage:** `IF condition THEN statement|line_number_`

Executes `statement` if `condition` evaluates as true. If
the condition is false, the execution of this line stops.
This differs from other BASICs.

Example:
```basic
IF X = 10 THEN PRINT "Hello"
```

### INPUT
**Usage:** `INPUT var`

Prompts for user input.

Example:
```basic
INPUT X
```

### KEY
**Usage:** `KEY [index, string]`

The KEY keyword lets you specify the text, that's printed,
when you press any of the F1..F12 function keys. Without
arguments, the keyword lists the current keyboard shortcuts.

### LET
**Usage:** `LET var = expr`

Assigns a value to a variable. `LET` is optional.

Example:
```basic
LET X = 5
```

### LIST
**Usage:** `LIST [from][-][to]`

Displays the program listing.

### LOAD
**Usage:** `LOAD "bas*folder/*.bas"`

Loads a program from the disk drive. You can use the forward
slash character to specify directories like `dir/file.bas`.
Wild-card characters `*` and `?` are supported in folders as
well as in file names.

### MOVSPR
**Usage:** `MOVSPR number, x25, y50`

Moves a sprite to a given screen location. The position
(0, 0), however is in the border. The top left coordinate
of the first visible character is (25, 50).

### NEW
**Usage:** `NEW`

Clears the current program from memory.

### MODULE
**Usage:** `MODULE name`

Modules are a great way to modularize complex code and reuse
existing listings. The interpreter holds a list of variable
spaces for each module as well as a program counter
(listing execution position) for each module.

With the MODULE keyword you can switch into the variable
space of another module. The program counter, however, still
is in the old module! This way you can modify code in the
sub-module. Calling RUN execute the module's code until it
calls END or reaches the end of it's listing.

After RUN or END, the current module is switched back to the
calling module.

It's a common technique to switch to a module, `LOAD` the
code, then END back to the main program. When required,
the module code can be executed using `MODULE name: RUN`.

Passing arguments back and forth can be done by prefixing
the variable name with the module name followed by a period
operator. `module.varname = 123`, which can be called from
any other module.

Example:
Type this example line by line into the interpreter:
```basic
10 M = 1
20 PRINT "IN MAIN "; M  : REM M=1
30 MODULE MYMOD
40 M = 2                : REM MYMOD.M=2
50 RUN                  : RUNS MYMOD'S CODE
60 PRINT "IN MAIN "; M  : REM M=1

REM THE MODULE KEYWORD WILL
REM BRING US INTO THE MODULE'S SPACE
MODULE MYMOD


10 PRINT "IN MODL "; M    : REM (MYMOD.) M=2
30 M=3                    : REM (MYMOD.) M=3
40 PRINT "IN MODL "; M    : REM (MYMOD.) M=3
50 END                    : REM BACK TO MAIN MODULE

REM THE END KEYWORD WILL
REM BRING US BACK TO THE MAIN MODULE
END

REM NOW RUN THE MAIN PROGRAM
RUN
```

Output:
```
IN MAIN 1
IN MODL 2
IN MODL 3
IN MAIN 1
```

### NETGET
***Usage:** `NETGET url$, c$`

Downloads a website and stores the returned bytes in c$,
which is interpreted as a UTF-8 string when `PRINT`ing.

It's best to provide the protocol (https:// or http://)
at the beginning of the URL. If it's omitted, https://
will be tried first, then http://.

### NEXT
**Usage:** `NEXT [var]`

Marks the end of a `FOR` loop, increasing `var` by `STEP`.

Example:
```basic
NEXT I
```

### ON
**Usage:** `ON expr GOTO/GOSUB line1, line2, ...`

Transfers execution to one of the specified lines based on
the value of `expr`.

Example:
```basic
ON X GOTO 100, 200, 300
```

### OPEN
**Usage:** `OPEN fileno, "filename , MODE_RW"`

Opens a file for reading or writing. When reading, wild-card
characters are supported. The mode "R" for reading or "W"
for writing must be part of the filename argument and
separated from the file name with an comma character.

Use `PRINT#1` to print to the opened fileno #1.

Don't forget to `CLOSE` the file afterwards.

### PLAY
**Usage:** `PLAY abc_notation$`

The PLAY command plays a music score in the background of
your program. The music string is in ABC music notation.

See the annex for details.


#### Technical Background
BA67 uses two command line tools for the `PLAY` command. Both must
be installed and in the PATH variable. On Windows, the programs must
be relative to the executable "bin\BA67.exe":
"..\3rd-party\abcMIDI\bin\abc2midi.exe"
"..\3rd-party\fluidsynth\bin\fluidsynth.exe"

ABC2MIDI is a GPL software and will thus not be distributed.
[abcmidi](https://ifdo.ca/~seymour/runabc/top.html) or
[github](https://github.com/sshlien/abcmidi)

For Fluidsynth, also a soundfont file must be present.
Currently BA67 searches for:

On Windows:
"..\3rd-party\fluid-soundfont-3.1\FluidR3_GM.sf2"

otherwise
"FluidR3_GM.sf2"
TODO: Find a better place where to install that file.

If any of these files cannot be found, BA67 uses a very, very
primitive ABC music notation parser, that generates the melody
using a sine wave. So, if `PLAY "C D E"` sounds terribly bad,
you're probably missing any of the above files.


### POKE
Puts a byte to a virtual memory address. This is only for
compatibility. The `PEEK` command can retrieve the value.
The memory has no influence on the machine, screen or other
devices.

**Usage:** `POKE address, byte`

Example:
```basic
POKE 1234, 128
```

### PRINT
Outputs text or values to the screen. You can use special
control characters. See the Annex D for more details.

**Usage:** `PRINT expr [[,|;| ] expr ...]`

Example:
```basic
PRINT "Hello, World!"
```

### PRINT USING
**Usage:** `PRINT USING format; expr [, expr ...]`

Outputs text or values as a formatted string to the screen.

Example:
```basic
10 PRINT USING "+##";1                 : REM "+ 1"
20 PRINT USING "#.##+";-0.01           : REM "0.01-"
30 PRINT USING "-.##";-0.1             : REM "-0.10"
40 PRINT USING "##.#-";1               : REM " 1.0"
50 PRINT USING "####";-100.5           : REM "-100"
60 PRINT USING "####";-1000            : REM "****"
70 PRINT USING "#.##";-4E-03           : REM "****"
80 PRINT USING "##.";10                : REM " 10"
90 PRINT USING "###.##"; 100           : REM "100.00"
100 PRINT USING "##.##";10.4           : REM "10.40"
110 PRINT USING "#,###.##";10000.0009  : REM "********"
120 PRINT USING "##,##";-1             : REM "  -1"
130 PRINT USING "##,##";-10            : REM " -10"
140 PRINT USING "##,##";-100.9         : REM "-101"
150 PRINT USING "+#.#^^^^";1           : REM "+1.0e+00"
160 PRINT USING "#^^^^";1.5E+11        : REM "2e+11"
1010 PRINT USING "##.##";"CBM"         : REM "CBM"
1020 PRINT USING "X##=##X";"CBM"       : REM "X CBM X"
```

### QUIT
**Usage:** `QUIT`

Quits the interpreter.

### QSAVE
**Usage:** `QSAVE`

Saves the current listing as the name that was last
loaded or saved.

### RCHARDEF
**Usage:** `RCHARDEF char$, mono, bits1, bits2, ..., bits8`

Reads the pixels for a character image. See `CHARDEF`
before reading this.

The `mono` parameter will be filled with -1 (yes, mono) or
0 (no, multicolor).
The `bits1..bits8` will hold either 8 bit values or 32 bit
values for each line of the character pixels.

### READ
**Usage:** `READ var[, var [, var2] ]`

Reads a variable from the next DATA keyword.

### REM
**Usage:** `REM comment`

Adds a comment in the program.

Example:
```basic
REM This is a comment
```

### RENUMBER
**Usage:** `RENUMBER [new__start, increment, old__start, milestone]`

Renumbers the program lines.
Where `new__start` specifies the first new line number to
use. The `old__start` parameter is the first line of the
current listing you want to start renumbering from.
With `increment`, you specify the leap per line.
The default is 10.
With `milestone` you can specify what line numbers
you want to keep and restart incrementing from this
number, then. The default is zero - no milestone.

*DO SAVE YOUR WORK* before you renumber the listing.

Please also see the `BAKE` command for using labels instead
of line numbers.

**Example:**
```basic
1 REM START
2 PRINT "HELLO"
100 REM SUBROUTINE-MILESTONE
...
180 RETURN

RENUMBER 1, 20, 100
LIST

20 REM START
40 PRINT "HELLO"
100 REM SUBROUTINE-MILESTONE
...
180 RETURN
```

### RESTORE
**Usage:** `RESTORE [line]`

Restores the next READ's DATA to the given line number or,
if omitted, the start of the program.

### RETURN
**Usage:** `RETURN`

Returns from a subroutine invoked with `GOSUB`.

Example:
```basic
RETURN
```

### RUN
**Usage:** `RUN [start_line_number]`

Executes the program. Optionally a line number can be passed
as the start of the processing.

If the program switched to a `MODULE` earlier, this will set
the active program listing to the module's code.

Optionally, a line number can be specified.


### SAVE
**Usage:** `SAVE "test.bas"`

Saves the BASIC program of the current module to a file on
the disk drive. The file extension ".BA67" is recommended.
If no file extension is given, it will be appended.

See also `QSAVE`.


### SCNCLR
**Usage:** `SCNCLR [n]`

Clears the screen and puts the cursor in the top left corner.
The optional parameter is ignored.

### SCRATCH
**Usage:** `SCRATCH "FILENAME"`

Scratches (deletes, removes, unlinks) a file from the current
directory. It also works on the CLOUD.

You are allowed to use wildcard characters `?` and `*`.

In direct mode `ARE YOU SURE (Y/N)?` will be requested, which
has to be answered with 'Y' for every file to be deleted.

Use this command really with caution. I will not take any
liability if the command might cause damage to your data.


### SLOW
**Usage:** `SLOW`

Slow mode is enabled. This adds a delay for every
instruction to approximately simulate the speed of a C64.


### SOUND
**Usage:** `SOUND voice, play$`

Plays a sound in the background. The parameters are passed
as a string, that's separated by spaces, commas or colons.

The voice is one of the 64 voice channels to mix the sounds.

BA67 uses DrPetter's SFXR. More details on the parameters
can be found on his homepage:
https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html

Optionally different sound engines might be used during
compilation. See Build chapter.

Here's the list of parameters:

### SPRDEF
**Usage:** `SPRDEF number, chars$`

Defines a sprite. You have 256 sprites to use. They are
overlaid over the character graphics and can be moved on
a per pixel basis.

In order to define a sprite, first you define characters.
Then you assign the character images to a sprite number.
A sprite consists of 3x2 character images.
You can select any color index to be transparent with the
3rd parameter. If you omit it, the sprite will not be
transparent.


### SPRITE
**Usage:** `SPRITE number, on, color, priority, x2, y2`

Changes the visibility and characteristics of a sprite.
The `on` parameter enables 1 or disables 0 the sprite.

If the bitmap is monochrome, the `color` sets the color
of the sprite. If it's a multicolor sprite, this sets
the transparent color index 1..16.

The `priority` parameter is currently not used.

The flags `x2` and `y2` enable 1 or disable 0 the scaling
of the sprite to twice it's size.

Sprites can be moved with `MOVSPR`.


### STEP
**Usage:** `FOR var=start TO end STEP increment`

Used in `FOR` loops to define an increment.
Example:
```basic
FOR I = 1 TO 10 STEP 2
```

### STOP
**Usage:** `STOP`

Stops the program, is if the escape key was pressed with the
`?BREAK IN line__number` message.

### SYS
**Usage:** `SYS "wget " + CHR$(22) + "www.ba67.org" + CHR$(22)`

If a string is given, the system's command is executed.
The string must be quoted. Otherwise we could not use
variables in the command string.
If a number is given, the command prints an error message.

It's required to have the command in quotes, so you can
use variables.

### THEN
**Usage:** `IF condition THEN expression|line` 

Used in conjunction with `IF` to specify the
action when the condition is true.
Example:
```basic
IF A > B THEN GOTO 100
```

### TO
**Usage:** `FOR var=start TO end [STEP increment]`

Used with `FOR` to specify the loop end value.
Example:
```basic
FOR I = 1 TO 5
```



-------------------------------------------------------------

### FRE
**Usage:** `FRE(0)`

Returns the amount of memory for PEEK and POKE operations.
On a C64, this would print the memory available for your
BASIC program.

### HEX$
**Usage:** `PRINT HEX$( $ff001234 )`

Returns a string representation of an integer number.

### INSTR
**Usage:** `position=INSTR(haystack$, needle$, [start__pos])`

Returns the first occurrence of `needle$` in `haystack$`.
The first character is the index `1`. A return value of
`0` indicates, that no match was found.

### INT
**Usage:** `INT(expr)`

Returns the integer portion of a number.

### JOY
**Usage:** `J = JOY(port) : REM 1..8 CW FROM 12:00. BUTTONS +128, +256`

Returns the status of a joypad/gamepad/joystick.
The return value is the same as in BASIC V7, but when you
press buttons 1 and 2, the value 128 ($80) is added
and by pressing buttons 3 or 4, the value 256 ($100) is added.

The d-pad position is numbered in clockwise order, for the eight
possible pad positions, you get:
```
8 1 2     + $100 button 1, 2
7 + 3     + $200 button 3, 4
6 5 4
```

For the port, you can provide a value of 1..16.
The ports 1..4 are used for XInput devices on Windows.
If no such device is connected, DirectInput devices are
used. If both, XInput device 1 and DirectInput device 1
are present, only XInput device 1 will be queried.

On Linux, maybe more gamepads are supported.

Example program to get the joypad directions:
```
500 J=JOY(N) : REM INPUT IS N, OUTPUT IS JX,JY AND JB
510 PRINT "JOY(";N;")=";J;"       "
520 D=J AND $0F
530 JX=0:JY=0:JB=0
540 IF D>=2 AND D=4 THEN JX=1

presents the mouse cursor positions on the screen. BA67 returns
25,50 for the top-left pixel of the first character on the screen.
The same coordinate system, that's used for sprites.

The return value depends on the argument value that is passed:
- `0` X position
- `1` Y position
- `2` X position (again)
- `3` Y position
- `4` Mouse button bits: 1, 2 and 4.

### POS
**Usage:** `POS(0)`

Returns the current horizontal cursor position.
The first column returns the number 0.
An argument must be passed, is however not evaluated.

### POSY
**Usage:** `POSY(0)`

The first row returns the number 0.
An argument must be passed, is however not evaluated.

### RIGHT$
**Usage:** `RIGHT$(string, n)`

Returns the rightmost `n` characters of a string. A character
is a Unicode code point.

### RND
**Usage:** `RND(n): REM 0..1`

The function RND generates pseudo random floating point numbers
in range [0..1].

 - By using RND(positive number) gives a different random number.
 - Using RND(negative number) sets the seed value.
 - With RND(0) the negative number is taken from the timer value.

Repeatedly calling RND with the same negative number results
in the same result. Typical use is to call RND(negative number)
once and then repeatedly call RND(positive number).

## A - ABC Music Notation
### ABC Music Notation - Basics
ABC notation is a simple text-based format for writing
music.

### Basic Structure
An ABC tune consists of metadata headers followed by the
music notation.

### Example:
```
X:1
T:Sample Tune
M:4/4
L:1/8
K:C
C D E F | G A B c |
```

### Key Components:
- `X:` - Tune index (required).
- `T:` - Title of the tune.
- `M:` - Time signature (e.g., `4/4`, `6/8`).
- `L:` - Default note length (e.g., `1/8` for eighth notes).
- `K:` - Key signature (e.g., `C`, `Gm`).

BA67 will always prefix this default header for you:
```
X:1
T:Song
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
```
You can simply overwrite the parts, that need to be changed.
Also, BA67 replaces any semicolon ';' with a newline
character, so you don't have to break short lines with
`CHR$(13)` - the newline character.

### Notes & Notation
- Letters `A-G` represent notes.
- Lowercase letters (`a-g`) represent higher octaves.
- `|` represents a bar line.
- Numbers (`2`, `3`, etc.) extend note duration
  (e.g., `C2` is a half note in `4/4`).
- `z` represents a rest.

### Chords & Decorations
- Chords: `[CEG]` plays a C major chord.
- Grace notes: `{d}` adds a grace note before the next note.
- Ties: `C-C` connects two notes.

### Instruments
- `I:instrument=X` where X is the instrument number of the
  MIDI Program number. The codes are listed on
  [midiprog.com](https://midiprog.com/program-numbers/) or
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI).
  
**Example**
```
X: 1
T: Smokey Waters
M: 4/4
L: 1/4
K: Em
%%MIDI program 29
E, G, A,2 | E, G, B,1/2-A,3/4 | -A,4
```

### Multi-Voice
ABC notation allows multiple voices to be written together
using `V:`.

```basic
PLAY "V:1; C D E F | G A G F |; V:2; G, A, B, C | D E D C |"
```
### Editors
You might want to have an editor to play around. Why not
write one yourself 🎵.
There are many editors for ABC music notation. Some
are even hosted online like on
[drawthedots.com](https://editor.drawthedots.com/).


### More Features
The percent sign `%` is used to indicate a comment.

ABC notation supports lyrics, ornaments, and multi-voice
arrangements, making it a flexible format for digital
sheet music.

For more details, visit
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation)
or [abcnotation.com](https://abcnotation.com) (which,
I'm afraid, is quite loaded with commercials).
Here's the standard: [abcnotation.com/wiki](https://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.1)

-------------------------------------------------------------
## B - Build, Using the Source Code
### CHARDEF
The line height must be a either 8 or 16 pixels.
If you re-implement BA67 in your own project and your
character height is defined to 16, but you only pass
8 lines, each line will be duplicated.
See ScreenInfo structure in the code.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## C - Cloud
Using `CHDIR "CLOUD"` you can access and share files with
multiple devices and users. The login-data is provided
using the `CLOUD` command.

This can be used to share code or high-score data. All
file commands should work on the could, too.

There are no directories in the cloud.

All filenames are and will be made upper-case.

You can use the provided demo server:
`CLOUD "examples@ba67.org", "http://www.ba67.org/cloud.php"`.
This is even the default value when you start BA67.
Please do not change, add or delete files of this cloud user.
You are even allowed to use your own email address with this
server. You email will not be send in clear text, but the
encryption is not strong, either.
Data is sent over HTTP in clear text.

You're not allowed to upload any material that might be illegal
anywhere on this planet. Your data is not safe from being hacked.

Do not "hack" this server. Everyone and his dog can do it.
You're not doing anything special. Instead, learn to code something
cool and show the world what you can do.

If you host `cloud.php` on an https server, things might be
a little more secure.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## D - Developers
Here's just a quick list of notes not to forget when
this chapter will be filled.
- Os::emojiPicker
- ScreenBuffer::copyWithLock
- ScreenInfo::charPixY

Keywords, Commands, Functions:
Keywords and commands are the same from the BASIC point of
view, but internally keywords get the unparsed tokens
as parameters, where commands already get evaluated
arguments as arguments.
Beware: In either case, you will get the comma separators
as individual arguments, because you can leave out arguments
like `CHAR ,,y,a$`.

## E - Escape (Control) Characters
Here's the list of CHR$() codes that produce special
control characters.
It's compatible with the Commodore PETSCII codes.

+-----+--------------+-------------------------------------+
|Code |How to Type   | Description                         |

## F - The Newline Dilemma
As the newline war subsides, in the 1980s we were not aware of
what was coming.

There are two ASCII characters for "end of line":
+---------------+------------+---+---+
|Name           |Abbreviation|Hex|Dec|
+---------------+------------+---+---+
|Carriage Return|CR          |$0d| 10|
+---------------+------------+---+---+
|Line Feed      |LF          |$0a| 13|
+---------------+------------+---+---+
Originally designed, the CR moved the cursor or typewriter's
print head to the left edge, where LF moved the cursor down
or the paper up.

Today, most systems agree, that a LF is enough to represent
"end of line". Windows still has CR LF in text files, but
can deal with just LF in most situations.

The 8 bit computers - and here's where it starts to get
complicated - each did their own thing.

Here's a short list of what each one did with the cursor
position:
+----------+---------+---------+
|COMPUTER  | CR      | LF      |
+----------+---------+---------+
|C64/C128  | X=0,Y+1 | Y+1     |
+----------+---------+---------+
|BBC       | Y+1     | X=0     |
+----------+---------+---------+
|CPC       | Y+1     | X=0     |
+----------+---------+---------+
|Apple     | Y+1     | X=0,Y+1 |
+----------+---------+---------+
|BA67      | X=0,Y+1 | X=0,Y+1 |
+----------+---------+---------+

So how to stay compatible with Commodore BASIC, but have
a modern implementation of it?

How to deal with the SYS command, loading and writing files?

It hurts, but I decided to break compatibility and make both
act the very same way on the screen. This way the CR is
compatible with Commodore and LF is compatible with
modern systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## G - Going from PETSCII to Unicode

When importing a .prg file or using the PETCAT hack,
all PETSCII characters are mapped to Unicode pendants.

Here's a test listing for you to see them:
```
1REMBA67 PETCAT
10 REM PRINT "{$01}{$02}{$03}{$04}{$05}{$06}{$07}8tn{$0b}{$0c}r{$0e}{$0f}"
20 REM PRINT "{$10}v{$12}hd{$15}{$16}{$17}{$18}{$19}{$1a}{$1b}{$1c}>{$1e}{$1f}"
30 PRINT "{$20}{$21}{$22}{$23}{$24}{$25}{$26}{$27}{$28}{$29}{$2a}{$2b}{$2c}{$2d}{$2e}{$2f}"
40 PRINT "{$30}{$31}{$32}{$33}{$34}{$35}{$36}{$37}{$38}{$39}{$3a}{$3b}{$3c}{$3d}{$3e}{$3f}"
50 PRINT "{$40}{$41}{$42}{$43}{$44}{$45}{$46}{$47}{$48}{$49}{$4a}{$4b}{$4c}{$4d}{$4e}{$4f}"
60 PRINT "{$50}{$51}{$52}{$53}{$54}{$55}{$56}{$57}{$58}{$59}{$5a}{$5b}{$5c}{$5d}{$5e}{$5f}"
70 PRINT "{$60}{$61}{$62}{$63}{$64}{$65}{$66}{$67}{$68}{$69}{$6a}{$6b}{$6c}{$6d}{$6e}{$6f}"
80 PRINT "{$70}{$71}{$72}{$73}{$74}{$75}{$76}{$77}{$78}{$79}{$7a}{$7b}{$7c}{$7d}{$7e}{$7f}"
90 REM PRINT "{$80}{$81}{$82}{$83}{$84}{$85}{$86}{$87}{$88}{$89}{$8a}{$8b}{$8c}{$8d}{$8e}{$8f}"
100 REM PRINT "{$90}^{$92}{$93}{$94}{$95}{$96}{$97}{$98}{$99}{$9a}{$9b}{$9c}<{$9e}{$9f}"
110 PRINT "{$a0}{$a1}{$a2}{$a3}{$a4}{$a5}{$a6}{$a7}{$a8}{$a9}{$aa}{$ab}{$ac}{$ad}{$ae}{$af}"
120 PRINT "{$b0}{$b1}{$b2}{$b3}{$b4}{$b5}{$b6}{$b7}{$b8}{$b9}{$ba}{$bb}{$bc}{$bd}{$be}{$bf}"
130 PRINT "{$c0}{$c1}{$c2}{$c3}{$c4}{$c5}{$c6}{$c7}{$c8}{$c9}{$ca}{$cb}{$cc}{$cd}{$ce}{$cf}"
140 PRINT "{$d0}{$d1}{$d2}{$d3}{$d4}{$d5}{$d6}{$d7}{$d8}{$d9}{$da}{$db}{$dc}{$dd}{$de}{$df}"
150 PRINT "{$e0}{$e1}{$e2}{$e3}{$e4}{$e5}{$e6}{$e7}{$e8}{$e9}{$ea}{$eb}{$ec}{$ed}{$ee}{$ef}"
160 PRINT "{$f0}{$f1}{$f2}{$f3}{$f4}{$f5}{$f6}{$f7}{$f8}{$f9}{$fa}{$fb}{$fc}{$fd}{$fe}{$ff}"
```

For more details about how BA67 maps PETSCII to Unicode, see
the function `PETSCII::toUnicode`.

If you save a .prg file, the mapping is done in reverse
order. Not all Unicode characters can be mapped, obviously.
If the mapping fails, the character $ff gets exported.
(Which defaults to π in the upper-case font.)

The following image shows what graphical symbol each
PETSCII code maps to. All characters of the CBM should be
represented, thus.

![image](petscii-mapping.png)
 - blue:   character is from upper case font
 - orange: character is ASCII -> not compatible with
           upper nor lowercase PETSCII
 - green:  character is taken from lower case PETSCII font
