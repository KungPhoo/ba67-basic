        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>
            BA67 was started with the vision of the C64
            having full Unicode support. As the project
            evolved, all Unicode characters were added
            and most of them were hand-crafted pixel-by-pixel.
            So, having this done, why not use this data
            to generate a true type font for daily
            coding work?
        </p>
        <p>
            The BA67 font is a merge of the original CBM
            fonts from the Commodore C64/C128,
            characters from <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/char8/">Char8.js</a>,
            and lots of hand-drawn emojis. It should support
            all existing Unicode characters (as of 2025-08).
        </p>
        <p>
            It's very crisp at font sizes multiples of 6 pt
            (6,12,18,24,…)
        </p>
        <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
        <p>
            The font shows crisp in font size 12 at 95 DPI.
            The squared version needs size 6 or 12.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some glyphs had been changed from the original
            Commodore version:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                m: The lowercase 'M' in 8 pixels is hard. It
                was changed to look a bit better besides an
                'n'.
            </li>
            <li>
                l: Lowercase L to better distinguish from '1'.
                It matches 't'.
            </li>
            <li>'&lt;' and '&gt;' less tall to better distinguish from '(' and ')'.</li>
            <li>'~' was thickened to match the double-pixel style.</li>
            <li>
                Apostrophe was straightened to match the quotation
                mark to distinguish from accents. ' ´ `
            </li>
            <li>
                b,d,f,h,i,j,k,l,t touch the top,
                as uppercase letters do.
            </li>
            <li>right-aligned the pound sign as M and W do.</li>
        </ul>
